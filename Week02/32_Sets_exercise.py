#  1. Create a Set
#Create a set named fruits containing at least 5 unique items (e.g., names of fruits).
#Print the set.


# 2. Check Membership
#Check if a specific item (e.g., "apple") is in fruits using the in keyword and print a message 
#confirming its presence or absence.



# 3. Add and Update Items
#Add a new element to fruits using the add() method. Print the set after adding.
#Create another set more_fruits with at least 3 unique items.
#Use the update() method to add elements from more_fruits to fruits. Print the updated set



# 4. Remove Items
#Remove an element from fruits using remove(). Print the set after removal.
#Attempt to remove an element not in the set using discard() and observe that no error occurs.
#Use pop() to remove and print an arbitrary element from fruits. Then print the set.
#Use clear() to remove all elements from a copy of fruits and print the empty set



# 5. Set Operations 
#Create two sets:
    #set_a with some overlapping items with fruits.
    #set_b with some different items.


#Perform and print the result of the following operations:
    #Union: Use union() to combine set_a and set_b.
    #Intersection: Use intersection() to find common elements between set_a and set_b.
    #Difference: Use difference() to find elements in set_a not in set_b.
    #Symmetric Difference: Use symmetric_difference() to find items in either set_a or set_b but not in both.


# 6. In-place Set Operations
#Use difference_update() on a set to remove items that are also in another set. Print the result.
#Use intersection_update() on a set to keep only items common with another set. Print the result.
#Use update() to add elements from another set to the current set. Print the result



# 7. Relational Methods
#Create two sets small_set and large_set such that small_set is a subset of large_set.
#Use issubset() to verify that small_set is a subset of large_set and print the result.
#Use issuperset() to verify that large_set is a superset of small_set and print the result.
#Check if two sets are disjoint using isdisjoint() and print the result
