#Mini Game Collection
#📌 Project Goal
#Students will design and implement three simple console-based games in Python.
#The goal is to apply programming fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, functions in 
# a fun way, as well as git and github flow knowledge and collaborative techniques to program in teams.

#🎯 Learning Objectives
#By completing this project, students will:
#Gain experience in structuring small Python programs.
#Learn how to use randomness, loops, and user input.
#Practice writing functions to organize code.
#Improve debugging and testing skills.
#Build confidence by finishing playable games.
#Practice coding in teams.
#Improve git and github flow use.

#🗓️ Weekly Breakdown
#Day 1–2: Game 1 — Number Guessing Game 🎲
#Computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100.
#Player guesses until correct.
#Program gives hints (“Too high!” / “Too low!”).

#👉 Concepts practiced:
#Random numbers (random.randint)
#Loops (while)
#Conditionals (if/else)

#Day 1–2: Game 2 — Rock, Paper, Scissors ✊✋✌️
#Player chooses rock/paper/scissors.
#Computer randomly picks one.
#Winner is decided and displayed.

#👉 Concepts practiced:
#Lists and choices
#Randomness
#Nested conditionals
#Simple scoring system (optional)

#Day 3–5: Game 3 — Tic-Tac-Toe ❌⭕
#Two players take turns (can start with 2-player mode).
#3x3 board displayed in console.
#Game checks for winner or draw.

#👉 Concepts practiced:
#Lists (to store board state)
#Functions (to check win/draw conditions)
#Loops for turns
#Printing a grid

#Day 4–5: Menu System
#Menu options displayed in console.
#Player chooses an option.
#If a game is choosen run the game.
#If exit is choosen, exit game
#If incorrect option is choosen send error message and ask again

#👉 Concepts practiced:
#Lists (to store option messages)
#Functions (to run the menu)
#Loops for prompting the user's choice
#Printing the options

#🗄️ Data Structures to Use
#Number Guessing: integers only.
#Rock, Paper, Scissors: lists (["rock", "paper", "scissors"]).
#Tic-Tac-Toe: 2D list or 1D list of 9 cells.

#📋 Menu System
#At the end of the week, students can put all games into one program with a menu:
#===== Python Mini Games =====
#1. Play Number Guessing
#2. Play Rock, Paper, Scissors
#3. Play Tic-Tac-Toe
#4. Exit
 
#✅ By the end of the week, students will have a playable game collection in Python, and 
# they’ll see how small programs can add up to something bigger.
