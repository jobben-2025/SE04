#Student Management System (with Sorting)
#📌 Project Goal

#The goal of this project is to design a console-based student management system in Python where students can be added, displayed, and sorted using different sorting algorithms.
#This project helps learners apply sorting algorithms in a practical context while practicing basic Python programming skills.

#🎯 Learning Objectives

#By completing this project, students will be able to:

#Understand and implement Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

#Work with lists and dictionaries as data structures in Python.

#Design and use a menu-driven system.

#Apply sorting algorithms to real-world data (student records).

#Strengthen problem-solving and structured programming skills.

#⚙️ Features to Implement

#Add Student

#Enter student details (name, age, grade).

#Store them in a list of dictionaries.

#Display Students

#Show all students in the system with their details.

#Sort by Grade (Bubble Sort)

#Use Bubble Sort to arrange students by their grade (ascending order).

#Sort by Name (Selection Sort)

#Use Selection Sort to arrange students alphabetically by name.

#Sort by Age (Insertion Sort)

#Use Insertion Sort to arrange students by age (ascending order).

#Exit

#Close the program.

#🗄️ Data Structures to Use

#List of Dictionaries

 
#students = [ {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": 88.5}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 22, "grade": 91.0} ]
#Each student record is stored as a dictionary, and all records are stored in a list.

#📋 Menu System (Console-Based)

#When the program runs, the following menu should appear:

 
#===== Student Management System ===== 
#1. Add Student
#2. Display Students
#3. Sort by Grade (Bubble Sort)
#4. Sort by Name (Selection Sort)
#5. Sort by Age (Insertion Sort)
#6. Exit
#The user selects an option by typing a number.

#After each operation, the menu is shown again until the user chooses Exit.
