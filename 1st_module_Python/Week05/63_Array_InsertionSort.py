#Insertion Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array (or subarray) 
# one item at a time. In each pass, it inserts the current element into the appropriate position 
# in the already sorted portion of the array. While it has a worst-case complexity of , it can be 
# much faster for nearly sorted data, sometimes approaching ,

#How It Works

#Consider the first element of the array as already sorted.
#Take the next element (the first unsorted) and compare it with the elements of the sorted 
# subarray from right to left.
#Shift all elements that are greater than this new element one position to the right.
#Insert the new element into the correct position.
#Repeat steps 2â€“4 for all remaining elements until the entire array is sorted.

#Worst O(n2), approaching O(n) for nearly sorted data.

#Key Points:
#In-place algorithm (requires no additional array).
#Often efficient for small or partially sorted datasets.
#Stable sort (preserves the order of equal elements)

#Big O Analysis

#Worst Case:  (Reversed Array) - O(n2)
#Explanation: When the array is in descending order, each new element is smaller than all preceding elements, requiring multiple shifts.
#Comparisons and shifts sum to about:

#Best Case: - O(n)
#Explanation: If the array is already sorted, each new element will be inserted immediately after only one comparison.
#Each element is compared once, resulting in a total of comparions of about:

#Average Case: - O(n2)
#Explanation: Elements usually move several positions for an arbitrary order.
