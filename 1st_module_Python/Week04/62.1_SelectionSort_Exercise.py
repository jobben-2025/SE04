#Selection Sort
#Activity 1: Find the Top 3 Numbers

#ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Write a Python program that uses Selection Sort to sort a list of numbers.
#After sorting, prints out the top 3 largest numbers.

#ðŸ‘‰ Example Input: [12, 45, 3, 67, 23, 89, 5]
#ðŸ‘‰ Expected Output: Top 3: [89, 67, 45]

#Activity 2: Find the Top 3 Numbers

#ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Rewrite the code above to order and print the top 3 smallest numbers.

#ðŸ‘‰ Example Input: [12, 45, 3, 67, 23, 89, 5]
#ðŸ‘‰ Expected Output: Top 3: [3, 12, 23]

#Activity 3: Sorting Cities by Name

#ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Write a program that ask the user for a list of cities (e.g., ["Paris", "London", "Berlin", "Rome"]) and sorts them alphabetically using Selection Sort.

#Activity 4: Sorting Cities By Length

#ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Modify the algorithm to sort by string length instead of alphabetically.
