# Book class
#Create a Book Class
#Define a class named Book.
#The Book class should have an __init__() method that takes parameters for the book’s name, author, and release_date.
#Store these parameters as attributes of the instance.
#Optionally, include a boolean attribute read initialized to False to track if the book has been read.


# Book collection class
#Create a BookCollection Class
#Define a class named BookCollection.
#In the __init__() method, initialize the books to a list of books passed to the constructor or an empty list.
#If you pass a list, verify its elements are indeed instances of a Book otherwise, raise and exception.


# 3. Add Books to the Collection
#Within the BookCollection class, create a method add_book(self, book) that takes a Book object as a parameter and adds it to the collection (self.books).
#Verify every new entry is indeed an instance of Book otherwise, raise and exception.

# 4. Mark Books as Read
#In the BookCollection class, implement a method mark_as_read(self, book_name) that:
#Searches for a book by its name in the collection.
#If found, sets its read attribute to True.
#If not found, optionally prints a message indicating the book isn’t in the collection.


# 5. Display Collection Status
#Optionally, add a method list_books(self) in BookCollection that prints out all the books with their details and read status.
