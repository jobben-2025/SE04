# 1. Sum of List Elements
#Create a function sum_list(numbers) that takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.
#Use a loop to iterate through the list.
#Use a variable to accumulate the total and return it.


# 2. Repeated Greeting
#Write a function repeat_greeting(name, times) that prints a greeting to name a specified number of times.
#Use a loop to print the greeting repeatedly.
#Each greeting should be printed on a new line.


# 3. Factorial Calculation
#Define a function factorial(n) that returns the factorial of a given number n.
#Use a loop (such as a for or while loop) to multiply numbers from 1 to n.
#Return the factorial result.



# 4. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
#Fibonacci Sequence Generator
#Create a function fibonacci(n) that returns a list containing the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
#Use loops and conditionals to calculate each Fibonacci number.
#Start the sequence with 0 and 1, then build the sequence up to n terms.


# 5. Maximum of Two Numbers
#Write a function max_of_two(a, b) that returns the larger of two numbers.
#Use an if...else conditional to compare a and b.
#Return the greater value.



# 6. Print a Pattern with Nested Loops
#Design a function print_triangle(rows) that prints a right-angled triangle of asterisks (*) with a given number of rows.
#Use nested loops: an outer loop for rows and an inner loop for printing asterisks in each row.
#Each subsequent row should have one more asterisk than the previous row
