#Custom object methods in Python follow the same rules as regular functions, with one important 
# distinction: they automatically receive a special first parameter, conventionally named self.

#This parameter represents the instance of the class on which the method is being called, allowing 
# access to the objectâ€™s attributes and other methods.
