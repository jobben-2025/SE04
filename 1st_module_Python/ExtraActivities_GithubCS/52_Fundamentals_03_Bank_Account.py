### Simple Bank Account Manager
#Goal:
#Build a Python program to manage simple bank accounts, practicing:

#String manipulation
#Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
#Conditionals (if/elif/else)
#Loops (while, for, nested loops)
#Functions
#Classes and objects
#Exit confirmation

#📊 Learning Objectives
#Create and use classes and objects.
#Use methods to operate on object data.
#Organize code with functions for modularity.
#Use loops and conditionals inside functions and methods.
#Practice searching, statistics, and exit confirmation logic.

#📌 Features to Implement
#Create Account – Store account holder’s name, account number, and initial balance.
#Deposit Money – Add an amount to the account balance.
#Withdraw Money – Subtract an amount from the balance (check for insufficient funds).
#View All Accounts – Display all account details.
#Search Account by Name or Number – Case-insensitive search.
#Show Statistics – Total accounts, total balance, average balance.
#Exit – Ask for confirmation before quitting.

#📂 Data Structures
#Class BankAccount with attributes:
#class BankAccount:
#           def __init__(self, name, account_number,
#           balance):
#                         self.name = name
#                         self.account_number = account_number
#                         self.balance = balance

#List → stores all BankAccount objects.
#Set → optional, to store unique account numbers.

#📜 Menu System
#The program should output 7 options to the user:
#               1. Create Account
#               2. Deposit Money
#               3. Withdraw Money
#               4. View All Accounts
#               5. Search Account
#               6. Show Statistics
#               7. Exit

#Then, it has to:
#Ask the user to enter the number of the action it wishes to carry out.
#If the number is not in the range 1 to 7, send and error message and ask for a correct option and 
# keep looping this action until the user chooses an option in the list.
#If the number is in the range 1 to 7 redirect them to the correct block of code.

#🛠 Classes and Functions to Create

#Class BankAccount
#Attributes: name, account_number, balance.
#Methods:
#deposit(amount) → adds to balance
#withdraw(amount) → subtracts from balance if sufficient funds
#display() → prints account info
#create_account(accounts_list)
#Ask for name → format with .title().
#Ask for account number → validate uniqueness.
#Ask for initial balance → validate as number.
#Create BankAccount object and append to list.
#deposit_to_account(accounts_list)
#Ask for account number.
#Search and deposit amount using the deposit method.
#withdraw_from_account(accounts_list)
#Ask for account number.
#Search and withdraw amount using the withdraw method.
#view_all_accounts(accounts_list)
#Loop through accounts and call each account’s display() method.
#search_account(accounts_list, query)
#Search by name or account number (case-insensitive).
#Display account info if found.
#show_statistics(accounts_list)
#Total accounts (len(accounts_list)).
#Total balance (sum of balances).
#Average balance.
#confirm_exit()
#Ask "Are you sure you want to exit? (yes/no)".
#Return True if yes, otherwise False.
