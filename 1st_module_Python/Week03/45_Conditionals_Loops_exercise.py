# 2. Grade Calculator
#Grade Calculator Given a score between 0 and 100, use if, elif, and else to determine and 
#print the corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or F).


# 3. Ternary Operator Practice
#Ternary Operator Practice Use a ternary operator to set a variable status to "adult" if age
#is 18 or older, and "minor" otherwise.


# 4. For Loop over a List
#For Loop over a List Iterate over a list of vehicles using a for loop and print an
#f-string with each vehicle


# 5. For Loop with Conditions
#For Loop with Conditions Loop over numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop and print only the 
#even numbers, skipping the odds using continue.



# 6. While Loop Summation
#While Loop Summation Use a while loop to sum all numbers from 1 to 100. Print the total
# sum at the end


# 7. Break out of a Loop
#Break out of a Loop Iterate over a list of words and break out of the loop as soon as 
# a word with more than 5 letters is found. Print that word.

# 8. Nested Loops
#Nested Loops Create a list of people and a list of pets. Loop over the lists in order 
# to print all the possible combinations of persons and a respective pet


# 9. Loop with Else Clause

# is found, print a success message and break out of the loop. Otherwise, after the loop finishes,
# use an else clause to print that the value was not found


# 10. Pass Statement Usage
#Pass Statement Usage Create an empty loop over a list of items using pass to practice structure 
# without executing any code


# 11. Pattern matching
#Create three lists: fruits, veggies, meat

#Add different food items to each list

#Create a match expression to determine if a given item in a variable item is a fruit, a veggie, a meat product or anything else.

#Remember you can create guards with if statements
