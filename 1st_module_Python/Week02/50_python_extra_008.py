#Conversions: Strings, Lists and Tuples

#Convert Between Data Types

### Step 1:

#1.  Create a list of hobbies.
    
#2.  Convert it to a tuple.
    
#3.  Convert it back to a list.
    
#4.  Add one more hobby to the list.
    
#5.  Transform the list of hobbies into a string.

### Step 2:

#1.  Create the tuple `person = ("Alice", 30, "New York")`.
    
#2.  Convert `person` into a list.
    
#3.  Add the hobbies string as the last item.
    
#4.  Convert it back into a tuple and print it.
    

### Step 3:

#1.  Create a tuple called `students = ("Alice", "Louis", "Paris", "Alice", "Sara", "Alex", "Alice")`.
    
#2.  Creacte a variable named `students_with_a` with an empty list as its value.
    
#3.  Use a `for` loop to store in the `students_with_a` list all the students with an `"a"` in the name in the tuple `students`.
    
#4.  Print the value and the data type of `students_with_a`.
    
#5.  Transform the list `students_with_a` into a tuple and store that new value in a variable named `students_with_a_tuple`.
    
#6.  Print the value and data type of the `students_with_a_tuple`.
