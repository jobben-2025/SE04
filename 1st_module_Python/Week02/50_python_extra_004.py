#Lists: Sorting, Counting & Reversing

#Sorting, Counting & Reversing

### Step 1:

#1.  Create a list of numbers.
    
#2.  Sort it in ascending order.
    
#3.  Count how many times a specific number appears.
    
#4.  Print the maximum and minimum number.
    

### Step 2:

#1.  Create a list with the names of the students in your class named `students`.
    
#2.  Print `students`.

#3.  Create a sorted copy of the list inside the variable `sorted_students`.
    
#4.  Print `sorted_students`.

#5.  Reverse the order of the original `students` list.
    
#6.  Print `students`.

#7.  Create a reversed copy of the `sorted_students` and store it into a variable named `sort_reversed`.
    
#8.  Print `sort_reversed`.
