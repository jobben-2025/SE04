#Tuples: Create and Access Tuples

#Create and Access Tuples

### Step 1:

#1.  Create a tuple called `person = ("Alice", 30, "Paris")`
    
#2.  Print each item using indexing.
    
#3.  Use a `for` loop to print all values.
    

### Step 2:

#1.  Create a tuple called `students = ("Alice", "Louis", "Paris", "Alice", "Sara", "Alex", "Alice")`.
    
#2.  Use a `for` loop to print each student in `students` that has an `"s"` in their name.
    
#3.  Count how many students named `"Alice"` are there in `students`.
    
#4.   Slice the three items in the middle of the tuple and assing them as the value of a new tuple named `middle`.
    
#5.  Create a tupled named `concat_tuple` and pass the value of both tuples, `person` and `students`.
    

### Step 3:

#1.  Create a tuple called `numbers` and add at least 5 numbers inside.
    
#2.  Print each item using a `for` loop.

#3.  Create a new tuple named `numbers_2` with by concatenating the values of `numbers` as many times as items are inside it.
    
#4.  Print the item in the middle of the `numbers_2` tuple.
