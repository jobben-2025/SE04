#Lists: Looping through lists

#Using `for` Loop with Lists

### Step 1:

#1.  Loop through each student in the `students` list and print: `"Hello [student_name]"`.
    
#2.  Create a list named `students_upper` and store in it a copy of the `students` list but with all items in uppercase.
    
#3.  Print the `students_upper` list.
    
#4.  Use a for loop to remove all the instances of `"Sara"` form the `students` list.
    

### Step 2:

#1.  Create a list named `fruits_With_A` and store in it a copy of the `fruits` list and lowercase those that have an `"a"` in the name.
    
#2.  Print the `fruits_With_A`.

#3.  Loop through each fruit in the `fruits` list and print: `"I like [fruit]"`.
    
#4.  Use a loop to append each item on the `fruits` list to the `healthy_food` list.
    
#5.  Print the updated list.
