# Step 1: Arithmetic Operators
#Create two variables: a and b, and assign them the values 15 and 4.




# Perform arithmetic operations
#Perform and print the result of each of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.



# Step 2: Assignment Operators
#Start with a variable x = 10.




# Modify x using assignment operators
#Use the +=, -=, *=, and /= operators to modify the value of x. Print the result after each operation



# Step 3: Comparison Operators
# Compare a and b
#Compare a and b using ==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=. Print the results of each comparison

# Step 4: Logical Operators
#Create two Boolean variables: is_python_fun = True and is_java_fun = False.


# Combine Boolean variables
#Use the and, or, and not operators to combine or negate these values. Print the results


# Step 5: Identity Operators
# Check identities
#Create two lists: list1 = [1, 2, 3] and list2 = list1.
#Check if list1 is list2 and if list1 is not list2.


# Check if list1 is list3
#Create a third list list3 = [1, 2, 3]. Check if list1 is list3



# Step 6: Membership Operators
#Create a string text = "Python programming is fun!"

# Check membership
#Check if the word "Python" is in the string.
#Check if the word "Java" is not in the string



# Step 7: Bitwise Operators (Bonus)
# Perform bitwise operations
#Perform the following operations with a = 5 and b = 3:
#Bitwise AND (&)
#Bitwise OR (|)
#Bitwise XOR (^)
#Bitwise left shift (<<) for a by 1
#Bitwise right shift (>>) for b by 1





# Step 8: Operator Precedence
# Write expressions with precedence
#Write an expression combining +, *, and ** operators. Use parentheses to change the order of operations.
#Evaluate the expression with and without parentheses to see how precedence works
