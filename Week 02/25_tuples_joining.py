# 1. Joining Tuples with Concatenation
fruits1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
fruits2 = ("date", "elderberry", "fig")

# Use the + operator to join (concatenate) the tuples
combined_fruits = fruits1 + fruits2
print("Combined Tuples (Concatenation):", combined_fruits)

# 2. Multiplying Tuples
# Repeat the tuple multiple times using the * operator
repeated_fruits = fruits1 * 2  # This will create a new tuple that repeats fruits1 twice
print("Repeated Tuple (Multiplied):", repeated_fruits)

# Another example using a numeric tuple
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
numbers_repeated = numbers * 3  # Repeats (1, 2, 3) three times
print("Repeated Numbers Tuple:", numbers_repeated)
